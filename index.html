			<h1>Welcome to the landing challenges page!</h1>
			<div id="main">
			<p>
			Here is where I will post weekly landing challenges at different airports around the world.<br>
			Some will be hard and for experinced player some will be easy and for new players.<br>
			The one draw back with using this website is you will have to set the weather your self.<br>
			I know this is a slight drawback but I will try to post 3-4 landing challenges per week, witch is faster than micrsoft posts theirs.<br>
			(the chalenges posted here will not be changed untill I submit the final version of this project)<br>
