	<h1>Welcome to the landing challenges page</h1>
	<p>
Here is where I will post weekly landing challenges at different airports around the world.<br>
Some will be hard and for experinced player some will be easy and for new players.<br>
The one draw back with using this website is you will have to set the weather your self.<br>
I know this is a slight drawback but I will try to post 3-4 landing challenges per week, witch is faster than micrsoft posts theirs.<br>
(the chalenges posted here will not be changed untill I submit the final version of this project)<br>
